*Made by Revival*

> **HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL — testing phase. Prone to game-breaking bugs. Not for normal play.**

# 1.0.1

- Marked the mod clearly as experimental/testing-phase in all package files
- VerboseLogging is now ON by default and records everything the sync system does:
  object registrations, client-mode transitions, grabs/releases/throws, snaps (with reason
  and distance), handbacks, dedupes, stale-host-data warnings, and 10-second stats
  (registered objects, held objects, host packet flow)

# 1.0.0

- Merged NetworkingRevived and NetworkTweaksRevived into one mod
- Host state is now captured at the raw network-event level (the original NetworkingReworked's
  proven technique) — immune to component order, other mods' patches, and the silent capture
  failures that left carts without host data
- Fixed held objects being skipped by drift correction when the game force-flags them
  "kinematic" for clients
- Doors and cabinets reverted to host-driven (with smoothing): their springs, joints and
  breaking are host-managed game logic that cannot be replicated locally without the
  springy/broken-door bugs — this matches what the original NetworkingReworked did
- Guaranteed cart steering, cargo riding, stuck-object snapping, velocity-aware drift
  correction, post-throw grace, timeout fix, LateUpdate dispatch and SmoothSync all carried
  over from the previous mods
- VerboseLogging now prints per-second held-object diagnostics (speed, drift, host packet age)
